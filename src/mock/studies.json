    "description": "This study aims to use clinical and biological characteristics of acute leukemias to screen for patient eligibility for available pediatric leukemia sub-trials. Testing bone marrow and blood from patients with leukemia that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat may provide information about the patient's leukemia that is important when deciding how to best treat it, and may help doctors find better ways to diagnose and treat leukemia in children, adolescents, and young adults."

Immunotherapy with flotetuzumab may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of leukemia cells to grow and spread. Giving flotetuzumab may stop the leukemia from growing or shrink for a period of time, as well as possibly lessening symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by the leukemia."

Chemotherapy drugs, such as liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called gemtuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Gemtuzumab attaches to CD33 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Giving liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin may help to control the disease."
